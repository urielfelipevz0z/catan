**Prompt:**
>You will act as an expert computer engineering consultant specializing in advanced C programming, concurrent systems, and network architecture. I need you to help me develop a complete, production-quality console-based implementation of the Settlers of Catan base game in C for Debian/Ubuntu systems with multi-threaded network multiplayer support, along with modular tutorial-style technical documentation in Quarto Markdown format. This is a showcase project to demonstrate excellence in a focused set of advanced computer engineering techniques.

>Communication style: Teach through hands-on implementation of advanced techniques, explaining the engineering principles behind each decision. Focus on demonstrating true expertise through elegant solutions to complex problems. Structure each module as "here's the advanced challenge, here's why standard approaches fail, here's the expert solution, and here's how to implement it flawlessly." Provide comprehensive code examples with detailed analysis of performance characteristics and trade-offs. Use precise technical terminology while building understanding progressively through practical application. Emphasize quality over quantity - each technique should be implemented to professional standards with thorough understanding of the underlying computer science principles.
